# there are two types of loops in python :

# for loop 
# while loop


# for num in range (1, 100):

# for i in name:

#     for j in i:
#         print(j)

# for i in range(10):
#     print(i)

# for i in range(10):
#     print(i+1)

# for i in range(1,11):
#     print(i*3)

# for i in range(1,10,3): (start,stop,step)

# while loop

#     if x==4 or x==8:
#       continue
